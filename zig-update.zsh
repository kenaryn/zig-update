#  TODO:
#  4)Add other available architectures to target a broader audience (e.g. x86_64-dragonfly, freebsd users)
#  6)Replace checking with $HOME/.zshrc file with PATH env variable (more robust in case a zig word
#+ unrelated to the language programming is in the same way found in the run-control file!).
#  7)Make the script system-wide executable by moving it to '/usr/bin' (see IPFS `install.sh`
#+ for further details).
#  8) Revert changes in case of installation's failure by stashing old binary (see ipfs-update
#+ tool for more details).
